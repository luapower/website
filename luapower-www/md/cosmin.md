<div style="text-align: justify">
I learned to program in 5^th^ grade on a Z80, and later on on a 486.
I got my first paying job when I was 17 when I wrote an online shop in php.

In the past I did a lot of Delphi, C++, Python, php and JavaScript but over
the years I settled on Lua, C, JavaScript and an obscure language called Terra.

I currently live in Bucharest and work as a developer and consultant
at [my own company](https://allegory.ro/) with a focus on business software.

My most significant open source project to date is luapower, the place which
gets most of the output of my current research interests, which include
vector graphics, GUIs, and p2p networks (I secretly dream of [putting them
all together](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJDv-zdhzMY) one day).
