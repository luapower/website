I learned to program in 5^th^ grade on a Z80, and later on on a 486.
I got my first paying job when I was 17 when I wrote an online shop in php.

I code mostly in Lua, Python, C, Javascript and Terra.

In the past I did a lot of Delphi in smokey apartment-sized companies
and then more Delphi in mall-sized corporations with a one-hour commute
(I also worked in a php farm for one month).

My last punching-card job was at [SellerEngine](http://sellerengine.com/)
where I developed products for large Amazon sellers.

I currently live in Bucharest, and work as a freelancer.

My most significant project to date is luapower, the place which gets most of
the output of my current research interests, which include vector graphics,
GUIs, and p2p networks (I secretly dream of [putting them
all together](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJDv-zdhzMY) one day).
